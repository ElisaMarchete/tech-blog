# Tech Blog

This is a Tech Blog where we share articles, tutorials, and insights about the latest technology trends, programming languages, software development practices, and more. The blog is intended for tech enthusiasts, developers, and anyone interested in staying up-to-date with the fast-paced world of technology.

## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site is built completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
